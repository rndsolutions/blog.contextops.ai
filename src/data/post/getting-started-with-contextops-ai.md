Welcome to ContextOps.ai! This guide is here to help you get started with our platform, giving you the essential steps to begin leveraging the power of our context-driven AI Assistant. We're still in development, but we've got some cool things to show and talk about :). We're working tirelessly to add more integrations that fit various use cases.

ContextOps.ai is designed to streamline your operations by providing context-aware AI Assistants that adapt to your specific needs. Whether you're looking to automate workflows, enhance decision-making, or improve efficiency, ContextOps.ai has got your back. We believe that chat and voice interfaces are the new way of doing things, and we want to enable youâ€”our usersâ€”to benefit from this movement and be more productive in your day-to-day lives.

## Sign Up

Right now, we're rolling out our features to a select group of eager users who are excited to try things out and join us on this journey. To get started with ContextOps.ai, just create your account and hop into our Discord community to say hi! [ðŸ”— Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/RNa7nds8). This process will stay in place while we're developing and testing with early adopters. Once we're ready for the big launch, it'll be open to everyone.


## Exploring the ContextOps AI

Once you're logged in, take a moment to check out the user interface. If you've used Chat GPT before, you'll find it super familiar and easy to navigate. Feel free to dive in, start asking questions, or engage in conversations!

Here's what you can do:
- Chat with the ContextOps Assistant by clicking the headphone icon. You might need to give your browser permission to use your microphone.
- Type in anything you're curious about and hit Enter.
- You can also record a voice message and send it to the ContextOps AI Assistant. It'll transcribe your message into text and submit your question to the Assistant.

In the top left corner, you can see your **Workspace**. It's basically your working environment where you can organize your knowledge, prompts, and chats with the assistant. Hit the pencil icon in the top left corner to open a new chat with the assistant. You can drag and drop chats and organize them in folders.

### Engage in chat conversation 

Now you can dive into exploring the capabilities of the AI Assistant. You can do many things, from chatting with it about a math problem to asking it to write a story for you or check out your stock portfolio. We'll be digging into more advanced use cases.

Chats on the left panel are grouped by dates so that they are easily discoverable. In addition, you can create additional folders/projects to group certain chats by topic or whatever makes sense to organize your content.
